In the modern age the progress of society is totally based on knowledge and information,
this information is available in vast amount and due to limited time it generates high 
demand to compress it into small sizes which can reflect the whole details in the most 
appropiate way. From older times it had been done manually by humans just as in a newspaper
the front page only have the summary of a news and the details are inside the newspaper,
manual work is very effective as it generates the compressed information all while keeping
different aspacts and effects of the information in mind, but this process is not efficient
and it will take very much time just to summarise a small book or magzine and hence it
generates the need to do this task manually.

Many research had already been done in this area which uses Natural Language Processing, 
Machine Learning Techniques and Deep Learning Techniques to summarize the text, The Goal 
of this project is to study these research from the beginning and then by using these create 
a model which can create summary with very high accuracy while being gentle on the processor.
